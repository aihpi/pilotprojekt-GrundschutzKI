# Results Directory

This directory contains evaluation results generated by `scripts/run_evaluation.py`.

Each evaluation run produces two files:
- `{output_name}.csv` - Detailed results with questions, answers, and RAGAS metrics
- `{output_name}.md` - Documentation of the experiment configuration and summary statistics

## File Naming Convention

Files should be named to provide information about the approach at first glance:
- `gpt-oss-120b_kompendium-xml.csv` - GPT-OSS-120B with XML Kompendium data
- `gpt-oss-120b_kompendium-json.csv` - GPT-OSS-120B with preprocessed JSON data
- etc.
